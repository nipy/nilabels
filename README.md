# NiLabels

NiLabels is a cacophony of tools to automate simple manipulations and measurements of medical image
segmentations in nifti format. It is strongly based on and influenced by the library [NiBabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/)

+ Written in [Python 3](https://docs.python-guide.org/)
+ [Motivations](https://github.com/SebastianoF/nilabels/wiki/Motivations)
+ [Features](https://github.com/SebastianoF/nilabels/wiki/What-you-can-do-with-nilabels)
+ [Design pattern](https://github.com/SebastianoF/nilabels/wiki/Design-Pattern)
+ [Work in progress](https://github.com/SebastianoF/nilabels/wiki/Work-in-Progress)

## Introductory examples

### 1 Manipulate labels: relabel

Given a segmentation, imagine you want to change the labels values from [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] to [2, 12, 4, 7, 5, 6]
and save the result in `my_new_segm.nii.gz`. Then:

```python
import nilabels as nil


nil_app = nil.App()
nil_app.manipulate_labels.relabel('my_segm.nii.gz', 'my_new_segm.nii.gz',  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [2, 12, 4, 7, 5, 6])

```

### 2 Manipulate labels: clean a segmentation

Given a parcellation for which we expect a single connected component per label, we want to have it cleaned from all the
extra components, merging them with the closest labels.

```python
import nilabels as nil


nil_app = nil.App()

nil_app.check.number_connected_components_per_label('noisy_segm.nii.gz', where_to_save_the_log_file='before_cleaning.txt')
nil_app.manipulate_labels.clean_segmentation('noisy_segm.nii.gz', 'cleaned_segm.nii.gz', force_overwriting=True)
nil_app.check.number_connected_components_per_label('cleaned_segm.nii.gz', where_to_save_the_log_file='after_cleaning.txt')

```

<img src="https://github.com/SebastianoF/nilabels/blob/master/examples/cleaning_before_after.png" width="600">
</p>

Before cleaning `check.number_connected_components_per_label` would return:

```text

Label 0 has 1 connected components
Label 1 has 13761 connected components
Label 2 has 14175 connected components
Label 3 has 14373 connected components
Label 4 has 1016 connected components
Label 5 has 806 connected components
Label 6 has 816 connected components
Label 7 has 1281 connected components
Label 8 has 977 connected components
Label 9 has 746 connected components
```

The same command after cleaning:

```text
Label 0 has 1 connected components
Label 1 has 1 connected components
Label 2 has 1 connected components
Label 3 has 1 connected components
Label 4 has 1 connected components
Label 5 has 1 connected components
Label 6 has 1 connected components
Label 7 has 1 connected components
Label 8 has 1 connected components
Label 9 has 1 connected components
```

## Instructions

+ [Documentation](https://github.com/SebastianoF/nilabels/wiki)
+ [How to install](https://github.com/SebastianoF/nilabels/wiki/Instructions)
+ [How to run the tests](https://github.com/SebastianoF/nilabels/wiki/Testing)

## Development

`nilabel` is a python package managed with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and linted with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), tested with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/)

## TODO

Other than the many TODOs around the code, there are two more things:

+ typechecking with mypy
+ migrate from cicleCI to github workflows
